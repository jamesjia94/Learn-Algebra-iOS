<strong>Radical Expressions</strong><br />
Now that we have reviewed radicals, it’s time to apply them in algebra! Any algebraic expression that contains radicals is called a <u>radical expression</u>. You can treat the variables the same way you treat the numbers. For example, the cube root of \(x^3\) is x, because x multiplied by itself three times is equal to \(x^3\). When taking the root of an expression without addition or subtraction signs, break the large term up into smaller terms, and apply the radical to each small term separately. For example, if we want to find the square root of \(4x^2\), we would separate the \(4x^2\) into two separate terms, 4 and \(x^2\). The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of \(x^2\) is ±x, which we will express as |x|. Our final answer is then 2|x|.<br />
Sometimes, we can’t fully simplify a radical. For example, let’s say we want to simplify \(\sqrt{18x^2 y^4}\). While \(x^2 y^4\) is easily square-rooted to \(|xy^2 |\), 18 is not a square of any whole numbers. Rather, we must break it down to its factors to see if we can factor out any squares. 18 is the product of 9 and 2, and since 9 is a square of 3, we can take the square root of it. We break 18 down into 2 * 9, so our radical looks like:<br />
\[\sqrt{9*x^2*y^4*2}\]<br />
We then break this radical into two parts to separate the 2.<br />
\[\sqrt{9*x^2*y^4}*\sqrt{2}\]<br />
The radical on the left is easily factorable, which we can factor to create:<br />
\[3xy^2*\sqrt{2}\text{, or }3xy\sqrt{2}\]</p>
