<p><b><font size="4"> Adding Polynomials</font></b></p>



Throughout your mathematics career, you have added many things. Now, itâ€™s time to add polynomials! In the first chapter, you were taught how to combine and add like terms. For example, when given the expression \(3x+2y+4x\), you grouped the x terms together and added them independent of the y term(s). The same concept applies to adding and subtracting polynomials. You can only add or subtract terms that have the same power as one another. Although the two terms in the expression \(3x^2+5x\) are both x terms, you cannot add them together because they have different degrees.</p>


<p><b><font size="4"> Terms with Multiple Variables</font></b></p>


<p>When you encounter terms with multiple variables, such as one with both x and y in it, the degrees of BOTH of the variables must match those of the term you are adding it to. For example, in the polynomial \(3x^2 y+2xy+4xy+xy^2+y\), only the terms \(2xy\) and \(4xy\) can be added to each other. The last term, y, cannot be added to any of the other terms because it lacks an x variable. Even though all of the other four terms have x in them, \(3x^2y\) has an x to the second degree, while \(xy^2\) has y to y the second degree. Because of this, these two terms cannot be combined, leaving 2xy and 4xy as the only two addable terms.</p>




<p><b><font size="4"> Subtracting Variables</font></b></p>


<p>The same is true when subtracting polynomials. Only terms that have the same variables to the same degrees can subtract each other. One thing to be careful about when subtracting polynomials is the sign before every term. Recall that if you subtract a negative term, you are actually adding the term because the two minus signs cancel out. This is especially important when you subtract something inside parentheses. In these cases, use the distributive property to distribute the negative sign into everything inside the parentheses. For example, to simplify \(3x-(2x-5)\), you first distribute the negative sign to both the terms inside the parentheses, changing the positive \(2x\) to a negative \(2x\) and the negative 5 to a positive 5. The expression would then be \(3x-2x+5\), which can then be simplified to \(x+5\).
