<p><font size=4><b>Completing the Square</font></b></p>
<p>While extracting the root is an extremely helpful way to solve quadratic equations,
 you may have noticed that for any quadratic \(a^2+bx+c=0\), either \(bx\) must equal to 0 or the quadratic must be a perfect square to solve by extracing the root.
 The method of completing the square makes use of this solving method by transforming any quadratic into one that can be solved by extracting the root.<br />
Before we begin, note that for any polynomial that is a perfect square, c is equal to \((\frac{b}{2})^2\). This is because when we FOIL a squared polynomial, we get \(a^2+2ab+b^2\). When b is a number instead of a variable, the coefficient for the middle term is \(2b\), which, when we divide by 2 and then square, gets us \(b^2\). Therefore, to complete the square of a polynomial given the first two terms, we halve the middle coefficient and square it to give us the final term.<br />
For example, if we wanted to transform \(x^2+8x=0\) into a perfect square, we would halve the middle coefficient, giving us 4, and then squaring that to give us 16. 
Thus, to make this a perfect polynomial, we must add 16 to both sides, because we can’t add 16 to just one side. 
Therefore, our final polynomial is \(x^2+8x+16=16\), which simplifies to \((x+4)^2=16\). 
To solve this, we extract the roots by square rooting both sides. This gives us \(x+4=±4\), which gives us the roots \(0\) and (\-8\).</p>
