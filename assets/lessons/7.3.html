<strong>Adding and Subtracting Expressions</strong><br />
To add radicals, you would treat them the same way you would treat variables. For example, if we wanted to add \(2\sqrt{7}+3\sqrt{7}\), we would treat \(\sqrt{7}\) as a variable, and only add the coefficients. In this example, the coefficients of the two radicals are 2 and 3, which we can easily add to form 5. Then it’s a simple matter of putting it back in front of the radical to create our answer, \(5\sqrt{7}\). If you want to subtract radicals, you would do the same process, albeit subtracting the coefficients rather than adding them.<br />
	If the radicands in the radicals are not the same, then the radicals cannot be added (just like different variables). Just like you can’t add 2x and 3y, you can’t add \(3\sqrt{2}+2\sqrt{3}\), because they both have different bases. We call them bases if we think of radicals in exponent form (\(\sqrt{3}=3^{\frac{1}{2}}\). 3 is the base in the exponenet). The same goes for subtraction; you can’t  subtract radicals with different radicands.<br />
	This doesn’t mean that any two radicals with different radicands can’t be subtracted; only those that are fully simplified. For example, it looks difficult to add \(2\sqrt{12}+3\sqrt{48}\). Although they appear to have different radicands, factoring them reveals a completely different story. If we factor 4 from the first radical and 16 from the second, we can change the radicals to \(4\sqrt{3}+12\sqrt{3}\). From here, we can easily add the two radicals by adding the coefficients to give us our answer of \(16\sqrt{3}\).<br />
	If you are ever asked to add or subtract a lot of radicals, begin by simplifying all of them. Then, if any of them share similar bases, add them together until no pairs remain. For example, if we want to simplify the expression \(\sqrt{5}+\sqrt{45}-\sqrt{36}+\sqrt{8}\), we would begin by simplifying the radicals. \(\sqrt{5}\) is simplified to its furthest form, so we will leave it as is. We can factor 9 from \(\sqrt{45}\), which gives us \(3\sqrt{5}\). \(\sqrt{36}\) is easily simplified to 6, and \(\sqrt{8}\) is simplified to \(2\sqrt{2}\). We then add all the radicals that share the same bases. This gives us \(6+2\sqrt{2}+4\sqrt{5}\), which is our final answer.<br />
Note that you CANNOT simply add the radicands. \(\sqrt{3}+ \sqrt{6}\) is not equal to \(\sqrt{3+6}=\sqrt{9}\), or 3. We can confirm this by evaluating the radicals. The square root of 3 is approximately equal to 1.73, and the square root of 6 is approximately equal to 2.45. The two added together should equal 4.16, which is significantly different from the answer we would have gotten had we added the radicands together.</p>
