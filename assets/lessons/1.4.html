<p><strong><font size ="4">Ratios</font></strong></p>
<p>A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ratio</span> is a relationship between two numbers. It is usually seen in one of these forms: \(\frac{a}{b}\), \(a \text{ to } b\), or \(a:b\), where a and b are the two numbers being compared. Fractions are good examples of ratios. For example, if class A has half as many students as class B, you would say that A has \(\frac{1}{2}\) as many students as B. Since for every student class A, there are two students in B, you can also say that the ratio of students in class A to class B is be \(1:2\), or \(1 \text{ to } 2\).</p>
<p>Ratios comparing different units are called <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rates</span>. The most common type you will see is speed, which is distance over time. You may be familiar with speed being expressed in miles per hour (mph) in the United States, or kilometers per hour (km/h) outside of the United States.</p>


<p><strong><font size ="4">Proportions</font></strong></p>

<p>An equation that sets two ratios equal to each other is called a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">proportion</span>. An example would be:</p>
<p>\[\frac{1}{2}=\frac{x}{3}\]</p>
<p>To solve this, treat it like any other equation with quotients. First, multiply both sides by the denominators to turn the fractions into one line statements. Multiplying both sides by \(3\) and \(2\) will result in the following:</p>
<p>\[3=2x\]</p>
<p>Then, it can easily be solved to reveal that \(x=\frac{3}{2}\). This process is called <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cross-multiplication</span>, a very useful method for solving proportions. A proportion in the form \(\frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}\) (one ratio equal to another ratio) can be expressed as \(ad=bc\), which then can be simplified using the principles from the previous lessons.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you may encounter proportion problems with multiple terms like this:</p>
<p>\[<br />
\frac{n+3}{6}=\frac{7}{3}<br />
\]</p>
<p>In order to solve for \(n\), you would cross multiply this like any other proportion problem. Be sure to group \((n+3)\) as a single term when doing the cross multiplication. The cross multiplication should result in the following equation:<br />
\[<br />
3(n+3) = 7(6) \]<br />
This can now be simplified using the distributive property to form \(3n+9=42\), which you can then solve to find \(n = 11\). </p>
