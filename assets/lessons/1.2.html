<p><strong><font size ="4"> Variables in Equations</font></strong></p>

<p>In the first lesson, we discussed algebraic equations. An equation sets two expressions equal to each other. Because the two expressions are equal, we can solve for any unknowns (variables) in these equations, and many problems will ask you to do just this.</p>
<p>Before we discuss how to find the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">solution,</span> or a value that replaces a variable to make the equation true, we must understand several properties of equations, one for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:</p>
<p>Addition Property of Equality: If \(A = B\), then \(A + c = B + c\)</p>
<p>Subtraction Property of Equality: If \(A = B\), then \(A - c = B - c\)</p>
<p>Multiplication Property of Equality: If \(A = B\), then \(cA = cB\)</p>
<p>Division Property of Equality: If \(A = B\), then \(\frac{A}{c} = \frac{B}{c}\)  as long as \(c\not=0\)</p>
<p>Sometimes, you will encounter algebraic expressions that contain parentheses. If you can simplify the expression inside of the parentheses, then great! If not, then you will have to make use of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">distributive property</span>. This property states that:</p>
<p>\[ a \left(b + c\right) = ab + ac\]</p>
<p>Note that the parentheses mean multiplication ( the inside times the outside). Basically, multiply each term on the inside by the number on the outside. For example:</p>
<p>\[ 5 \left(3x+2\right)<br />
\\ 5 \left(3x\right)+5 \left(2\right)<br />
\\ 15x+10 \]</p>
<p>These properties will help us simplify and solve equations.</p>
<p>In order to find the solution for an equation, we want to isolate the variable on one side and the numbers on the other. For now, we will work with only one variable. For example, if we are given the equation \(2x + 5 = 7\), we start by isolating the term with the variable in it by itself. Using the subtraction property of equality, we can subtract \(5\) from both sides. This will result in \(2x + 5 – 5 = 7 – 5\), causing the \(5\)’s to cancel out on the left side, resulting in \(2x = 2\). Then using the division property of equality, we can divide each side by \(2\), leaving us with \(x = 1\). In order to check that this solution is correct, we replace each \(x\) in the original equation with 1. We will get \(2(1) + 5 = 7\), which simplifies to \(2 + 5 = 7\), which is true, so this solution makes sense. If you cannot get a solution that causes the equation to make sense, then there is no solution for the equation.</p>

<p><b><font size ="4"> Fractions as Coefficients</font></b></p>

<p>You will also encounter equations involving fractions as coefficients, such as \(\frac{4}{5} x-3=17\). Like in the previous example, we isolate the term with the variable in it before dealing with the coefficient. By moving the \(3\) to the other side through the addition property of equality, we get \(\frac{4}{5} x = 20\). From here, we can multiply both sides by \(5\) to get rid of the denominator, and then divide by \(4\) to get rid of the numerator. This is the same as multiplying both sides by the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reciprocal</span> of the coefficient. The reciprocal is the original fraction with the top and bottom number switched (so \(\frac{4}{5}\) would become \(\frac{5}{4}\)).</p>
<p>From the first method, we would get these results:</p>
<p>\[ \frac{4}{5} x=20 \\ \frac{4}{5} \left(5\right)x=20\left(5\right) \\ 4x=100 \\ \frac{4}{4} x= \frac{100}{4} \\ x=25 \]</p>
<p>By the second method, we would follow this process:</p>
<p>\[<br />
\frac{4}{5} x=20<br />
\\ \frac{4}{5} \left(\frac{5}{4}\right) x=20 \left(\frac{5}{4}\right)<br />
\\ \frac{20}{20} x= \frac{100}{4}<br />
\\ x=25 \]</p>
<p>Both methods will yield the same answer because both methods do the same thing. It is up to you to decide which method to use.</p>


<p><strong><font size ="4">Equations with Variables in Multiple Terms</font></strong></p>
<p>Oftentimes, you will be provided equations with multiple variables. For example, you may see the equation \(4x+3x-3=11\). To solve equations like this, we follow the same method that we did in the previous lesson. First, we begin by isolating the variables on one side and the numbers on the other side. This will lead to the following equation: \(4x + 3x = 14\). Then we combine like terms, adding \(3x\) and \(4x\) together, so the equation becomes \(7x = 14\). From here, we can divide both sides by \(7\) so the equation simplifies into \(x=2\).</p>
<p>When you encounter variables on opposite sides of the equals sign, you will follow the same method for “moving” numbers. Through the same properties of equality, you can “move” a variable to the other side to group the variables together. For example, in the equation \(3x + 5 = 2x + 8\), we would begin by subtracting \(5\) from both sides, so the equation reads \(3x = 2x + 3\). We would then subtract \(2x\) from both sides just like how we subtracted \(5\) from both sides, revealing the solution as \(x = 3\).</p>
<p>Sometimes you may encounter equations that have no answer. These equations are called <span style="text-decoration: underline;">contradictions</span>. Just because a textbook or a teacher gives you an equation to solve doesn’t mean it has to have a solution. For example, look at the equation \(2x=2 \left(x + 5\right)\). First, use the distributive property to simplify the rightmost expression. This will result in the equation \(2x = 2x + 10\). Then, we would subtract \(2x\) from both sides, creating the equation \(0 = 10\). But wait! We know that \(0\) cannot equal to \(10\) because that’s not how things work. This is an example of a contradiction.</p>
<p>Sometimes the opposite happens. Sometimes the equation will be true no matter what value of the variable is. For example, the equation \(4x + 8 = 2\left(2x + 4\right)\) will be true no matter what value of x is substituted in. In order to solve this, we begin by simplifying the right-side expression through the distributive property, giving us \(4x + 8 = 4x + 8\). Because both sides of the equation are the same, this equation would be true no matter what. If x were \(0\), we would get \(8 = 8\). If x were \(1\), we would get \(12 = 12\). No matter what we do, we would get the same value on both sides. This is called an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">identity</span>.</p>
<p>You may also encounter equations with decimals. You may see something like \(0.2x + 1.5 = 0.5x – 3.6\). While this may look intimidating, it isn&#8217;t hard to turn these decimals into whole numbers. First, multiply both sides by \(10\), which we are allowed to do by the multiplicative property of equality. This will result in the following: \(2x + 15 = 5x – 36\). Remember to multiply every term by \(10\), not just decimals. From here, we can solve it like any other equation, and reveal the answer as \(x = 17\).</p>
