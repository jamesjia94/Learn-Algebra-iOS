<p><strong><font size= "4">Variables</font></strong></p>

<p>A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">variable</span> is a symbol that is used to represent a number. Generally, this symbol is represented through a letter, most commonly \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), or \(z\). However, any letter can be used. For example, in the expression \(8x + 17\), \(x\) is the variable.</p>

<p><strong><font size= "4">Expressions and Equations</font></strong></p>

<p>An <span style="text-decoration: underline;">expression</span> is a phrase that represents a number. While this may have a variable, it does not necessarily need one. For example, \(6 + 2\) is an expression. \(6x+2\) is as well.</p>
<p>An <span style="text-decoration: underline;">equation</span> is an expression with an equals sign. Like expressions, equations can have, but do not need, variables. For example, \(6 + 2 = 8\) is an equation.</p>
<p>An <span style="text-decoration: underline;">algebraic expression</span> is an expression that DOES contain a variable, while an algebraic equation an equation that contains a variable.</p>
<p>Expressions or equations could also contain more than one different kind of variable. These variables can have, but do not have to have, the same value. For more on multiple variables, refer to chapter 2.</p>

<p><strong><font size= "4">Terms, Coefficients, and Constants </font></strong></p>

<p>A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">term</span> is any part of an expression that doesn’t have addition or subtraction signs with it (negative signs are DIFFERENT from subtraction signs). For instance, in the expression \(14x + 7\), \(14x\) and 7 are the terms. If a term is being subtracted from another term, then that term is negative. In the expression \(14x – 7\), the two terms are \(14x\) and \(-7\). Also, be sure to simplify multiplication and division signs. If you encounter an expression such as \(14 × y\) or \(14 ÷ y\), simplify this into a single term. \(14 × y\) would be \(14y\) and \(14 ÷ y\) would be a fraction, \(\frac{14}{y} \).</p>
<p>In any term where there is a variable being multiplied by a number, the number is called the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">coefficient</span>. For example, for the term \(14x\), the coefficient is \(14\). If a variable does not have a number in front of it, the coefficient is \(1\) (because \(1 × a\) would be \(a\), rather than \(1a\)).</p>
<p>If a term does not have any variables in it, it is called a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">constant</span>. While variables can change in value, a number cannot. For instance, the number \(5\) can never change its value. No matter what, \(5\) will always equal \(5\).</p>

<p><strong><font size= "4">Simplifying Expressions</font></strong></p>

<p>Most of the time, you will encounter expressions or equations with multiple variables and multiple instances of the same variable, such as \(4x + 2y + 3x\). In order to simplify this, you group all the terms with the same variables together and combine them, also known as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">combining like terms</span>. In this case, both \(4x\) and \(3x\) contain the variable \(x\), while \(2y\) contains the variable \(y\). So, you would group \(4x\) and \(3x\) together, and leave \(y\) by itself, so the expression is now \(4x + 3x + 2y\). Because the terms \(4x\) and \(3x\) contain the same variable, you can add them together to create \(7x\). Then add the \(2y\) afterwards, so that the expression is \(7x + 2y\). You cannot, however, combine the \(x\) terms and the \(y\) term because \(x\) and \(y\) are different variables.</p>
