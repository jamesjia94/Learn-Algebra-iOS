<p><strong><font size ="4">Dividing Polynomials by Monomials</font></strong></p>
<p>Before we begin this lesson, be sure to remember the quotient rule for exponents (outlined below for your convenience).<br>
\[\frac{x^m}{x^n} =x^{m-n}\]<br>
	Whenever you divide a variable that has a higher power by the same variable with a smaller power, you essentially subtract the higher power by the smaller power, and set the base to the resulting power. For example:<br>
\[\frac{9x^5}{3x^2}\]<br>
	To simplify this, separate the coefficients from the variables, and divide those separately. Then, divide the variables. This will yield \(\frac{9}{3}*\frac{x^5}{x^2}\), which is equal to \({3x^3}\).<br>
	Not all divisions will be as simple as this; you will often encounter polynomials rather than monomials. To divide these, remember this property:<br>
\[\frac{a+b}{c}=\frac{a}{c}+\frac{b}{c}\]<br>
	You can essentially split any polynomial into a number of monomial fractions, making it significantly simpler to simplify. For example:<br>
\[\frac{6x^3+9x^2+12x}{3x}\]<br>
	Can be split into the following and simplified:<br>
\[\frac{6x^3}{3x}+\frac{9x^2}{3x}+\frac{12x}{3x}=2x^2+3x+4\]<br>
	If you ever consider it necessary to check your answers, multiply the quotient by the divisor and check if it equals the dividend. If they are equal, then you divided correctly; if not, then you messed up somewhere. To remind you what is the dividend and what is the divisor, look below.<br>
\[\frac{\text{dividend}}{\text{divisor}}=\text{quotient}\]<br>

	When you have to divide a polynomial by something larger than a monomial, however, you cannot use the same method that we have been using thus far. Instead, you must rely on the faithful old method of long division. Letâ€™s say we wanted to simplify the expression:<br>
\[\frac{x^3+3x^2-8x-20}{x+2}\]<br>
	We would then put the top polynomial on the inside of the angle thing and the bottom polynomial on the outside, as shown below:</p>

<p>Then, we would try to divide \(x^3 + 3x^2\) by \(x + 2\). To find the term that we multiply our divisor by to divide \(x^3 + 3x^2\), we divide the leading term of the divided by the leading term of the divisor, or \(x^3\) by \(x\), to get \(x^2\). We then put that in and subtract, then bring down the next term:</p>
<p><img src="4-3-2.png" alt="4-3-2 GOES HERE" align="center"></p>
<p>For the second term, we would again divide the leading term by the leading term, getting us x. We then add this behind the \(x^2\) in the quotient thus far.</p>
<p><img src="4-3-3.png" alt="4-3-3 GOES HERE" align="center"></p>
<p>Subtracting \(2x\) from \(-8x\) would yield \(-10x\), which is then divided by our divisor to finalize our quotient. </p>
