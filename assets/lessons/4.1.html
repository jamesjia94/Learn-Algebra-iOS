<p><b><font size="4"> Basics of Polynomials</font></b></p>



<p>Now that we’ve extensively covered variables, it is time to discuss polynomials. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Polynomials</span> are algebraic expressions that contain multiple terms with at least one variable-term in them that have only whole number non-negative exponents. For example \(2xy^2+5x\) and \(5x+1\) are examples of polynomials.</p>


<p><b><font size="4"> Degrees of Polynomials</font></b></p>

<p>Polynomials are composed of terms, each with varying degrees. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">degree of a term</span> is the value of the exponent attached to the variable, or the sum of the exponents if there is more than one variable. For constants, the degree is 0. For example, the degree of the term  would be 2. In the term \(3x^3 y\), it would be 4, because it is the sum of the degree of x and of y.</p>
<p>Each polynomial also has its own degree, called the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">degree of the polynomial</span>. This degree is the largest single degree of all of its terms. For example, the polynomial \(6x^2 y+3x^3 y^2-2y\)  has a degree of 5, because of the degrees of the three terms (3, 5, 1), the middle term has the highest degree.</p>
<p>The degree of a polynomial is used to classify the type of polynomial. One of the more common “polynomials” is a polynomial with degree 0, or a constant (something you should be familiar with by now). A polynomial with degree 1 is considered a linear polynomial, because when graphed as a function (covered in the next paragraph) the graph forms a straight line. One with a degree of 2 would be a quadratic (something extensively covered in later chapters), and one with degree 3 is considered a cubic (not important to learn right now). You probably won’t encounter polynomials with a degree larger than 3 in Algebra 1, but any polynomial with a degree of 4 or higher would be considered a fourth-degree polynomial (or fifth-degree for a degree of 5, and so on).</p>
<p>Polynomials can also be part of functions. Recall in lesson 2-7 the use of a function. Each function is used to transform an input into an output. When a polynomial is used as a function, the type of polynomial determines the type of function. For example, in the function \(f(x)=3x^2+5x-1\), the polynomial is quadratic, making the function also quadratic. The uses of these types of functions will be taught in later lessons.</p>




<p><b><font size="4"> Number of terms in Polynomials</font></b></p>

<p>While polynomials can be classified by their degree, they can also be classified by the number of terms that they contain. The most common is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">monomial</span>, or a single term polynomial. For example, \(3x^2\) is a monomial. A polynomial that has two terms is called a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">binomial</span>, and a polynomial that has three terms is called a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">trinomial</span>. While there are names for polynomials with four, five, and other numbers of terms, we usually just call them polynomials.</p>





<p>Although you have seen polynomials with multiple variables in this lesson, you will usually only be given single variable polynomials to work with. These are usually organized in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">standard form</span>, which looks like this:<br />
\[a_nx^n+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+...+a_1 x+a_0\]<br />

Don’t worry if this appears intimidating. All this means is that each term is organized in the format coefficient * variable<sup>degree</sup>. For example, \(3x^2\), \(5y^4\), \(2x\), and \(8a^6\) are examples of terms that would fit in standard form. The second thing important rule is that all the terms in this polynomial will have the same variable. If there is a term with x in it, for instance, there cannot be a term with y or z in it. Finally, the terms are sorted from highest degree, starting from the left, to lowest degree, ending on the right. An example of a polynomial in proper standard form would be \(x^2+2x+2\). If a polynomial is missing a term, then the coefficient for that term is 0.</p>
