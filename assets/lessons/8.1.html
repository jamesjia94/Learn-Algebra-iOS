<p>	Recall how we find the roots of the equation \(x^2-4=0\). 
To do this, we factor it to give us \((x-2)(x+2)=0\), which we can easily solve for our solutions, \(2\) and \(-2\). 
While this is a good way to solve when the number is a square of something, it grows more difficult when it isn’t. 
For example, if we were given the equation \(x^2-5=0\), we would find this both annoying and difficult to factor.
An easier way to solve this is to solve it by extracting the root.<br />
To do this, we isolate the squared variable on one side and the number on the left side. 
For the previous example, we would arrange it such that \(x^2=5\). 
From here, we can take the square root of \(5\) to solve for x, which gives us: \(x=±\sqrt{5}\).
 Recall that there can be two solutions for square roots because the negative sign is eliminated when the expression is squared. As such, we will have two solutions whenever we extract the roots.<br />
Sometimes, you will encounter equations that square polynomials rather than just variables. For example, you may be asked to solve:<br />
\[(x+3)^2=25\]<br />
While we could solve this by expanding \((x+3)^2\) and solving that way, we could also solve it through a much simpler method by extracting the roots. We do this by taking the square root of both sides, which gives us:<br />
\[x+3=±5<br />
\\x=2,-8\]</p>
