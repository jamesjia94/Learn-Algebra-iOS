<p><strong><font size= "4">Factoring</font></strong></p>

Recall that when you multiply any number of numbers, they will result in another number, called the product. This is a concept you know (or should know) well as multiplication. Now, we’re going to discuss doing this process backwards. Just as you can multiply two numbers together to create a product, you can break that product up into two numbers that multiply each other to form the product, called <span style="text-decoration: underline;">factors</span>. This process is called <span style="text-decoration: underline;">factorization</span>. Factorization isn’t limited to only two factors, though; you can break some numbers up into a lot of different factors. For example, consider the number 60. We can break it up into:<br />
\[60 = 2 * 30<br />
\\60 = 2 * 3 * 10<br />
\\60 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5\]<br />
By the time we get to the last factorization, we can no longer separate any of the factors into more factors without multiplying by 1 a lot of times. Each of these factors is called a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">prime number</span> because you can no longer break it down into any other factors. Recall that a prime number has only two whole number factors, itself and 1. For example, 5 is a prime factor, because it can only be broken down into 1 and 5. 12 is NOT a prime factor, because you can break it down into much more than just 1 and 12. While all of the factorizations for 60 above are valid, only the bottom one is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">prime factorization</span>, which is a factorization that consists only of prime factors.</p>
<p>You will sometimes be asked to find the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">greatest common factor</span> of two numbers. The greatest common factor is basically the largest factor that both of the two numbers share. To find it, break the two numbers down into their prime factorizations, find all the factors that the two numbers share, and multiply them together. For example, let’s say we wanted to find the GCF (the abbreviation of greatest common factor) of 28 and 42. We would first break them down into their prime factorizations:<br />
\[28 = 2 * 14 = 2 * 2 * 7<br />
\\42 = 2 * 21 = 2 * 3 * 7\]<br />
Notice that the two numbers both share the factors 2 and 7. We would then multiply them together to get 14, which is the greatest common factor of the two numbers. Note that the GCF does NOT have to be a prime factor. If you encounter two numbers that share no factors other than 1, then they are considered <span style="text-decoration: underline;">relatively prime</span>, and their GCF is 1.<br />

<p><strong><font size= "4">Factoring Monomials</font></strong></p>

You will also have to factorize monomials. For example, let’s say we wanted to factor 6x<sup>5</sup>. We would begin by separating the coefficient from the variable, and factoring the two separately.<br />
\[6x^5 = 6 * x^5<br />
\\6x^5 = 2 * 3 * x^5<br />
\\6x^5 = 2 * 3 * x * x * x * x * x\]<br />
Essentially, you would treat the variable as any other number. A variable to the power of 1 cannot be broken down any further. To find the GCF of any two monomials, you would follow the same process that you did to find the GCF of two numbers, with the only difference being that you have to deal with variables. For example, let’s find the GCF of \(4x^6y\) and \(2x^4y^9\). We begin by breaking them down into their components, although to keep it short and simple, we will leave the exponents the way they are.<br />
\[4x^6y = 2 * 2 * x^6 * y<br />
\\2x^4y^9= 2 * x^4 * y^9\]<br />
We then compare each component and look for common factors. For the coefficients, both monomials have a factor of 2, so our GCF will begin with 2. Then, we consider the x variables. Since \(x^6\) is equal to \(x^4* x^2\), both monomials also share x<sup>4</sup> as a factor. For y, y<sup>9</sup> is equal to y<sup>8</sup> * y, so both monomials will have y as a greatest common factor. When we multiply all these factors together, we will get 2x<sup>4</sup>y as the greatest common factor of our two monomials. To check our work, we divide both of these monomials by our GCF, and see if we can find any other shared factors that remain. As the below divisions demonstrate, no common factors remain.</p>
<p>\[\frac{4x^6 y}{2x^4 y}=2x^2<br />
\\\frac{2x^4 y^9}{2x^4 y}=y^8\]</p>

<p><strong><font size= "4">Factoring Polynomials</font></strong></p>

Now that we understand factoring single terms, we will discuss factoring polynomials. Before we begin, we must review the distributive property. Recall that to simplify this, we multiply a to each of the terms inside the parentheses:<br />
\[a (b + c) = ab + ac\]<br />
In factoring, we do the opposite. Rather than distributing a to the contents of a parentheses to create ab and ac, we create an expression with a parentheses that contains them. This is essentially the opposite of multiplying, and is called <span style="text-decoration: underline;">factoring</span>. Here’s a demonstration on how to factor a polynomial.</p>
<p>Let’s say we want to factor the polynomial \(12x + 36\). We begin by factoring out the GCF for both of these terms. To find the GCF, we would find the prime factorization and multiply the common factors together. We could also factor out any obvious factors from the parentheses, and keep factoring until no factors remain. Both methods are demonstrated below.</p>
<p>2 is an obvious factor for \(12x + 36\). We’ll factor that out.</p>
<p>\[2 (6x + 18)\]</p>
<p>We can still factor out another 2.</p>
<p>\[2 * 2 (3x + 9)\]</p>
<p>We can factor out 3.</p>
<p>\[2 * 2 * 3 (x + 3) = 12 (x + 3)\]</p>
<p>Both methods are perfectly valid ways to factor polynomials. Sometimes, you might encounter polynomials that can’t be factored, much like numbers that can’t be factored. Just like these numbers, they are also called primes. For more on factoring trinomials and binomials, refer to the next few lessons. For now, we’ll discuss how to factor four term polynomials.<br />

<p><strong><font size= "4">Factoring by Grouping</font></strong></p>

During your algebra career, you won’t have to factor many four term polynomials, as the majority of polynomials you will encounter will be trinomials or binomials. If you do encounter one, however, there is a special method of factorization called <span style="text-decoration: underline;">factoring by grouping</span>. Here’s a demonstration. Let’s say we want to factor the four term polynomial \(2x^3 + 4x^2 + 6x + 12\). We’ll begin by grouping the first two terms together and the last two terms, as such:</p>
<p>\[(2x^3 + 4x^2) + (6x + 12)\]</p>
<p>We then factor the two groups together, pulling 2x<sup>2</sup> from the first group and 6 from the second. This results in: \(2x^2(x + 2) + 6(x + 2)\). From here, we will treat \(2x^2(x + 2)\) as a single term, and \(6(x + 2)\) as another single term. If we then try to find the greatest common factor of these two terms, we find that they share a single factor, \((x + 2)\) (remember that we treat something surrounded with parentheses as a single term). We can then factor this out, causing our expression to change to: \((x + 2)(2x^2 + 6)\). But wait! While \((x + 2)\) is fully factorized, we can still factor a 2 from \((2x^2 + 6)\), which changes our expression to \(2(x + 2)(x^2 + 3)\), which is our final factorization.</p>
