<p><strong><font size= "4">Factoring Trinomials of the Form $x^2+bx+c$</font></strong></p>

In the previous lesson, we discussed how to reverse the distributive property to factor the greatest common factor from a polynomial. Now, we�ll discuss how to factor trinomials into two binomials. Recall from the previous chapter how $(a + b)(c + d)$ simplifies to $ac + ad + bc + bd$ from the FOIL method. Just like we reversed the distributive property for factoring the GCF from a polynomial, we�ll reverse engineer the FOIL method to factor trinomials.</p>
<p>For example, consider the polynomial $x^2 + 5x + 6$. We need to convert this to two binomials. But wait! There�s only three terms here, while the FOIL method yields four terms. This is because there is only a single variable in this trinomial. Here�s a short demonstration. If we were to simplify $(x + 2)(x + 3)$, we would get $x^2 + 3x + 2x + 6$. Notice how two of the four terms share the same degree variable, and thus, can be added together to form $x^2 + 5x + 6$. If we want to factor the trinomial, we must then break up the middle term into two terms to do a reverse FOIL. To do this, we find two factors of the last term (in this case, 6) which add together to equal the middle term. With 6, we have two factorization options, 1 � 6, and 2 � 3. We need to find which pair adds up together to equal to the middle term�s coefficient, in this case 5. 1 and 6 add up to equal 7, so it�s not that; 2 and 3, on the other hand, add up to match the middle coefficient. Now that we have our two factors, we create the two binomials, in the form $(x + factor_1)$ and $(x + factor_2)$ to produce our answer, $(x + 2)(x + 3)$. You can use the FOIL method on this answer to see how it works. To simplify this for future reference, here�s a formula:<br />
$$x^2+ (m + n)x + mn = (x + m)(x + n)$$<br />
Let�s have some additional practice. Say you wanted to factor the polynomial $x^2 + 7x + 12$. We would first break 12 down into two factors, into the form mn as in the formula above. Our available options are: 1 � 12, 2 � 6, and 3 � 4. 1 and 12 add up to equal 13, so they are not it; 2 and 6 add up to be 8, eliminating them as well. 3 and 4, on the other hand, add up to 7, satisfying our search. We then plug the two into the binomials to give us our answer, $(x + 3)(x + 4)$.</p>
<p>Trinomials can also contain negatives. If the trinomial contains a negative sign anywhere, then at least one of the factors is a negative. If there is a negative before the last term, such as in $x^2 + 5x � 6$, then only one of the factors is negative. If the sign before the last term is positive but the sign before the middle term is negative as in $x^2 � 7x + 6$, then that means both of the factors is negative. Here�s a demonstration on how to factor the two examples above.</p>
<p>In the example $x^2 + 5x � 6$, the number of factors increase to include negative factors. If it were positive, then the only two factors would be 1 and 6, and 2 and 3. Now that one of the signs is negative, then we add a bunch of new factor sets: -1 and 6, 1 and -6, -2 and 3, and 2 and -3. Although the positive set 2 and 3 both add up to 5, neither of the factors in the set are negative, so 2 and 3 are not the factors. We must then choose from the negative factor sets. Out of these four, only -1 and 6 add up to be 5 (1 and -6 adds up to -5, which would satisfy the trinomial $x^2 � 5x � 6$), and constitute the answer. The factored form of this trinomial is then $(x � 1)(x + 6)$.</p>
<p>For the example $x^2 � 7x + 6$, we again must consider new factor sets. Although 1 and 6, and 2 and 3 are both valid ways to factor 6, none of them can add up to equal a negative number. Since the sign before the 6 is positive, then both of the factors must be negative (because the two negatives will cancel out to produce a positive when you FOIL the answer). Thus, the only two factor sets we can consider are -1 and -6, and -2 and -3. Only -1 and -6 add up to equal -7, and therefore, form the answer $(x � 1)(x � 6)$.</p>

<p><strong><font size= "4">Factoring Trinomials of the Form $ax^2+bx+c$</font></strong></p>

Thus far, we have only discussed trinomials with a coefficient of 1 for the first term. You will, however, encounter trinomials of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$, with a representing the added coefficient. The format for factoring trinomials of this form is relatively similar to its $x^2 + bx + c$ counterpart; the only difference is that we must account for this new coefficient. Once again, we operate through a reverse FOIL method. Recall that when simplifying the expression below, we get:<br />
$$(a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd$$<br />
	And that for a coefficient-less trinomial, it simplifies as:<br />
$$x2 + (m + n)x + mn = (x + m)(x + n)$$<br />
For a trinomial with a coefficient, however, the FOIL method would return something different. Rather than merely adding m and n in the center, they are also multiplied by the coefficient (or factors of the coefficient). Before, we didn�t multiply any additional factors because a and c were effectively 1, and anything multiplied by 1 is equal to itself. The general form for a trinomial of this format is:<br />
$$pqx2 + (pn + qm)x + mn = (px + m)(qx + n)$$<br />
	The coefficient a from the trinomial $ax^2 + bx + c$ is represented as the product of p and q. To find p and q from a, we must factor a into two factors and find a pair of two factors that satisfy the equation above. Here�s an example. Let�s say we wanted to factor the equation $4x^2 + 10x + 6$. We would begin by finding factors of 6 as we normally do, and we get the two factor sets 1 and 6, and 2 and 3. Since there are no negatives in this trinomial, we don�t have to bother ourselves with finding negative factor sets. Now, we also have to find factors of 4 for the same reason that we found factors of 6. We then get the two factor sets 1 and 4, and 2 and 2. Now, we have to multiply the factor sets of 6 and the factor sets of 4 and see which results add up to equal 10. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to find out which sets form the correct solution; as such, you will have to guess and check your way through this. After a lot of guess and check, we find that 2 and 2, and 2 and 3 multiply together $(2 * 2 + 2 * 3)$ to equal to 10. We then place the factor set for the first term on the left side of the binomials, and the factor set for the last term on the right side of the binomials.<br />
	There is a way to simplify this process, however. Recall that we can factor out the GCF from a binomial, simplifying something like $15x + 3$ to $3(5x + 1)$. We can do the same for trinomials as well before factoring them any further. In the previous example, we could easily factor out 2 before we did any factoring. This would result in the following: $2(2x^2 + 5x + 3)$. To factor this, we would factor both 2 and 3. Since both of them are prime, there is only one way to factor both of them, 1 and 2, and 1 and 3. We then have to find a way to multiply them such that they add up to 5. If we multiply 1 and 1, and 2 and 3, we get 1 + 6 = 7, which isn�t equal to 5. Our only option is 1 and 3, and 2 and 1, which add up to equal 5. We then arrange them as such: $2(2x + 3)(x + 1)$. This way, when you FOIL it, the 2 from 2x multiplies the 1 in the right binomial, and the 1 from the x multiplies the 3 in the left binomial to FOIL correctly. </p>
