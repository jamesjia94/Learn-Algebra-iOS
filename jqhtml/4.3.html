<p>Recall from the first chapter the distributive property. Whenever you encounter an expression such as $5(2x+3)$, you multiply all of the terms inside of the parentheses with the outside number. Multiplying by a monomial works the same way. For instance, to simplify the expression $5x(2x+3)$, we would first distribute 5x into every term inside the parentheses, resulting in:</p>
<p>$$(5x*2x)+(5x*3)<br>
\\10x^2+15x$$</p>
<p>Multiplying binomials together follows a similar process. For example, if you wanted to simplify $(2x+1)(5x+7)$, you could follow the same process for multiplying by a monomial. Treat the $(2x + 1)$ as a single term, and multiply that to each term inside the second binomial. This would simplify to $(2x+1)(5x)+(2x+1)(7)$, which you can then simplify again.</p>
<p>However, there is a simpler way to do this. For any two binomials $(a+b)$ and $(c+d)$, their product can be calculated from the formula below:</p>
<p>$$(a+b)(c+d)=ac+ad+bc+bd$$</p>
<p>This is known as the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">FOIL</span> method. FOIL stands for �first, outer, inner, last,�. First refers to <em>ac</em>, or the first two terms of both binomials. Outer refers to <em>ad</em>, or the outer terms being multiplied. Inner refers to <em>bc</em>, or the inner terms being multiplied, and last refers to bd, or the last two terms of both binomials. However, this method only works for binomials multiplying binomials.</p>
<p>You may also be asked to evaluate an expression with an exponent in it, $(x+1)^3$. Recall that exponents multiply the base the number of times specified in the power. The power rule does apply NOT in this case because there is more than one term inside the parentheses. The power rule ONLY works for a single term, NOT multiple terms. To simplify this, you would multiply $(x + 1)$ by itself three times, like this:</p>
<p>$$(x+1)(x+1)(x+1)$$</p>
<p>To do this, you would use the FOIL method to multiply two of the three binomials together, while leaving the other one outside. We would then get $x^2 + 2x + 1$ as the result of $(x + 1)^2$. This would leave $(x+1)(x^2+2x+1)$. To evaluate this, multiply each term inside the trinomial with the binomial. This would lead to the following:</p>
<p>$$(x+1)(x^2 )+(x+1)(2x)+(x+1)(1)<br>
\$x^3+x^2 )+(2x^2+2x)+(x+1)$$<br>
            Which simplifies to $x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1$.</p>
<p>There are several common polynomial multiples that you will encounter in algebra, and it is recommended that you memorize these so you do not have to work them out every single time. They are as follows:</p>
<p>$$<br>
(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2<br>
\$a-b)^2=a^2-2ab+b^2<br>
\$a+b)(a-b)=a^2-b^2<br>
$$<br>
The first two are the squares of polynomials. When you FOIL either the first or the second, the outer and inner terms are equal to each other, causing the sum to double. Here�s a demonstration:</p>
<p>$$(x+1)^2<br>
\\x^2+x+x+1<br>
\\x^2+2x+1$$</p>
<p>For the third equation, called a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">difference of squares</span>, the outer and inner terms cancel each other out. Here�s an example:</p>
<p>$$(3x+1)(3x-1)<br>
\\9x^2+3x-3x-1<br>
\\9x^2-1$$</p>
