<p>When we are given a system of equations, we are given not only two equations, but two variables, generally x and y. We cannot solve either x or y when given a single two-variable equation. It is possible to solve, however, once we are given two equations. While there are a number of different methods for solving two equations at once (called a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">linear system</span>), the method we will discuss now is called the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">substitution method</span>.</p>
<p>In this method, we choose one of the two equations, and solve for one of the variables before working with the second equation. It doesn�t matter which equation you choose, but it is generally easier to choose the equation where one of the variables has no coefficient. For example, the following is a linear system:</p>
<p>$$x-3y=2<br />
\\2x+2y=12$$</p>

<p>While we could choose either equation to start with, we will start with the top equation because the x variable doesn�t have a coefficient. Now that we�ve chosen our equation, we will solve for x. But wait! There are two variables here, so we can�t find a numerical solution to x. However, we can solve for x in terms of y (so x is by itself). To do this, we will add 3y to both sides, resulting in the following equation: $x=3y+2$.</p>

<p><b><font size= "4"> Combining the Equations</font></b></p>

<p>Now that we know what x is equal to in terms of y, we will replace the x in the second equation with the solution from the first equation. Because $3y + 2$ is equal to x, we can substitute x with $3y + 2$ in the second equation, resulting in the following: $2(3y+2)+2y=12$.</p>
<p>From here, we have transformed the second equation into a single variable linear equation, making it easier to find the numerical value of y. Solving this, we find that y = 1. Now that we know what y is equal to, we can substitute that back into the either of the two original equations and solve for x. Since $x=3y+2$ and $y = 1$, we get that $x = 5$. Now, we have both x and y; $x = 5$ and $y = 1$.</p>
<p>In the future, you probably won�t be given equations where one of the variables has no coefficient; rather, all of them will most likely have coefficients. While this may inconvenience you, just treat the first equation as any other linear equation and remember to divide by the coefficient of the variable you are solving for.</p>
