<p><strong><font size= "4">Factoring Special Binomials</font></strong></p>

Recall from the previous chapter the special binomial called the difference of squares. For your reference, it follows below in both its expanded and factored form:<br />
$$(a + b)(a � b) = a^2 � b^2$$	Now, we will learn to factor this binomial. Whenever you see two squares separated by a minus sign, you can factor it into the form on the left. For example, in the binomial $x^2 + 16$, the two squares are $x^2$ and $16$. We then take the square roots of these two squares, and arrange them in $(a + b)(a � b)$ format. The two square roots are x and 4, which we can arrange to form the answer $(x + 4)(x � 4)$.<br />
	Some of the squares you encounter may not only be to the power of 2. For example, the binomial $x^4 � 16$ can also be factored in the same way. We start by finding the square roots of the two terms, resulting in $x^2$$4$. When we place them in the factored form, we get $(x^2 � 4)(x^2 + 4)$. But wait! $(x^2 � 4)$ can be factored further as a difference of two squares. If we factor this any further, we get $(x � 2)(x + 2)(x^2 + 4)$, which is our final answer.<br />
While a difference of squares is easily factorable, you may be wondering about a sum of squares, in the form $a^2 + b^2$. To put it simply, you CANNOT factor a sum of squares.<br />
Another important binomial (or two binomials) that you should know are the sum and difference of cubes, which, along with their factored forms, are listed below:<br />
$$a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 � ab + b^2)<br />
\\a^3 � b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$$	If we ever encounter any binomial with two cubes separated by a plus or minus sign, we can factor them as either a sum or difference of cubes, depending on the sign. If it�s a plus sign, then it�s a sum, and if it�s a minus sign, it�s a difference. For example, if we want to factor $x^3 + 8$, we first find the cube roots of the two terms. The cube root of $x^3$ is $x$, and the cube root of 8 is 2. We then arrange them in the formula above for sums, which produces our solution as $(x + 8)(x^2 � 2x + 4)$. Although factoring binomials such as this and a difference of squares requires significantly less effort than trinomials, it requires the memorization of these formulas. Memorize how to factor a difference of squares and a sum and difference of cubes, and you should be good.</p>
