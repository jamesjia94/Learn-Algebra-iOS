<p><strong><font size= "4">Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions</font></strong></p>

Adding rational expressions is just like adding fractions; you need to have the same denominator. Look at this example:<br />
$${5x}/{(2x-1)}+{x^2}/{2}$$<br />
In order to add these, we need to make the denominators the same, so we multiply the first term by 2 and the second one by $(2x-1)$. Then we just add. That leaves our answer as:<br />
$${10x+x^2 (2x-1)}/{2(2x-1)}$$<br />
The same can be done with subtraction. Just remember to always equalize the denominators.<br />
You will also need to know how to add and subtract rational expressions. Just like multiplying and dividing rational functions, this is the relationship:<br />
$$(f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)$$<br />
This looks very similar to what we saw in the last lesson. It just means that if you see $(f+g)(x)$, just add the two terms together. </p>
