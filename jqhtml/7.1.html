<strong>Square Roots</strong><br />
Recall that the <u>square root</u> of a number is a number that, when squared, equals the original number. In the two expressions below, a is the square root,x is the <u>radicand</u>, and the symbol is called a radical sign.<br />
$$a^2 = x, \sqrt{x} = �a$$<br />
In exponent form, this can be expressed as:<br />
$$\sqrt{x} = x^{{1}/{2}}$$<br />
a can be both positive and negative. Because $(-a)^2$ is equal to $a^2$, with the dual negatives cancelling one another out, it is also a square root. Therefore, for every x, there are two square roots: positive a and negative a. Although a can be negative, x cannot. We�ve shown that when positive numbers are squared, they are positive. When negative numbers are squared, they are also positive. As such, there are no real numbers that can be squared to produce a negative number. Thus, for our purposes so far, we can conclude that:<br />
$$\sqrt{a^2} = a\text{, if and only if } a ≥ 0$$<br />
For practice, we�ll find the square root of some fairly common numbers. Let�s start by simplifying $\sqrt{25}$. If you know your squares (which you should at this point), you can easily recall that the square root of $25$ is $5$ because $5^2$ is equal to $25$. Recall that since the negative root is also a root, -5 is also a root of 25. Thus, our two roots are 5 and -5.<br />
Not all square roots will be perfect squares. For instance, you might encounter a problem that tells you to simplify something with the $\sqrt{2}$. In this case, you would either approximate it using a calculator or leave it as it is. For example, let�s say we want to simplify the expression $2(\sqrt{36})(\sqrt{2})$. We would break the expression into 3 different components and simplify each component separately. Since 2 is in its most simplified form, we will leave that alone. $\sqrt{36}$, however, can be simplified into �6, which will then be the simplified form of our second component. Finally, we must deal with $\sqrt{2}$. We could either approximate it with a calculator to provide us with something close to �1.414, or leave it as it is, as $\sqrt{2}$. Our final answer would be: $(2 * �6 * \sqrt{2})$, which simplifies to $�12\sqrt{2}$.</p>
<p><Cube Roots><br />
The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cube root</span> of a number is the opposite of a cube, much like the square root is the opposite of a square. Basically,<br />
$$3\sqrt{x} = x^{1}/{3} = a\text{, }a^3 = x$$<br />
In other words, the cube root of x is the number that, when multiplied by itself three times, is equal to x. For example, the cube root of 125 is 5, because 53, or 5 * 5 * 5, is equal to 125. Unlike square roots, the number being cube rooted CAN be negative, because a negative multiplied by itself 3 times is still negative. This is displayed below:<br />
$$-1 � -1 � -1<br />
\$-1 � -1) � -1<br />
\\1 � -1<br />
\\-1$$<br />
Basically, any even number of negatives will be positive, because each negative sign can pair up with another one to cancel out. When there is an odd number of negatives, however, there will always be an odd one out, leaving the final solution negative. Thus, a negative number to the power of 7 would be negative, while a negative number to the power of 54 would be positive.<br />
Returning to the subject of cube roots, a cube root is basically a square root, except it allows negatives and applies for 3 self-multiplications instead of 2. You may also notice that a cube root has a small 3 in front of the radical sign, while the square root has none. This 3 is called the index, which specifies how many times the number must multiply itself to form the radicand. A square root is implied to have an index of 2, despite not explicitly displaying one.<br />
This can be expanded into indexes greater than 3. For example, to express the fourth root of 81, we would write: $\sqrt[4]{81}$, which is equal to �3. In this example, 4 is the index, 81 is the radicand, and �3 are the roots. Instead of continuously using � to show both roots of a radical, we can simply take the absolute value of the root. We can write the answer to the previous example as: $\sqrt[4]{81} = |3|$.</p>
