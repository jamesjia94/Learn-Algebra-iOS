Multiplying rational expressions is not very difficult at all. Take a look at this expression:<br />
$${4x+3}/{3}�{2}/{(5x-5)}$$<br />
All you need to do to multiply these two terms is to multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. So your answer looks like this:<br />
$${8x+6}/{15x-5}$$<br />
This is the distributed version, but you don�t have to distribute if you don�t want to. Now that we can multiply rational expressions, we will combine this with simplifying expressions. Multiply and simplify this expression:<br />
$${(x+1)}/{5x^4}�{2x^2}/{7}$$<br />
Remember that you can cancel out exponents if the bases are the same. So, first multiplying the two terms together give us:<br />
$${2x^2 (x+1)}/{35x^4} $$<br />
Then simplify:<br />
$${2(x+1)}/{35x^2}$$<br />
Now that we can multiply expressions, we also need to learn how to divide expressions. Dividing expression works very much like multiplying expressions. Look at the following expression:<br />
$${2x}/{(5x-1)}�{1}/{x^5}$$<br />
Remember that in a fraction, we divide the numerator by the denominator. So, if we divide by ${1}/{x^5}$, we�re dividing by the denominator twice. That just means that we multiply by the denominator and divide by the numerator. If this seems complicated, just remember this: make the numerator the denominator and the denominator the numerator. Then multiply normally. Here is the simplified version of the above term:<br />
$${2x^6}/{(5x-1)}$$<br />
We multiplied the by reciprocal of the second term (flipping the top and bottom), which is the exact same and dividing by the original term. Now try this example:<br />
$${(2-3x)}/{5x}�{8}/{7x}$$<br />
Just multiply by the reciprocal and you get this:<br />
$${7x(2-3x)}/{40x}$$</p>

We so far have only been dealing with rational expressions. Now we will work with rational equations. There are basically the same as normally equations, but with one important difference to remember. In the last lesson, we talked about restrictions to the domain. In equations, we also have to think about restrictions. Look at this equation and find its restrictions:<br />
$$f(x)={12}/{(5x-1)}$$<br />
Similar to expressions, restrictions occur when one side of the equation is undefined. For this equation, if $x={1}/{5}$, then the denominator is 0, and the right side is undefined. So, x cannot equal ${1}/{5}$. Another thing that you will need to do is combine rational equations. Look at the following equation:<br />
$$(f�g)(x)=f(x)�g(x)$$<br />
This means that if you see $(f�g)(x)$, that means you just take each function and multiply them together. If you are multiplying instead of dividing, then just do the same thing with multiplying the reciprocal. </p>
