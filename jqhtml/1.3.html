<p><strong><font size ="4">Inequalities</font></strong></p>
<p>In the past, we have discussed equations, which set two expressions equal to each other. Now, we will cover <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inequalities</span>, which relate the values of two expressions that may not (and often cannot) be equal to each other. Here are the main signs used for inequalities:</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Sign</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$a > b$</td>
<td>$a$ is greater than $b$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$a < b$</td>
<td>$a$ is less than $b$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$a ≥ b$</td>
<td>$a$ is greater than or equal to $b$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$a ≤ b$</td>
<td>$a$ is less than or equal to $b$</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>	Algebraic inequalities relate the values of two expressions using these signs instead of an equals sign like in an equation. For example, $x=2$ is an equation, and $x<2$ is an inequality. This inequality states that $x$ is less than $2$. While an equation would have a set number of solutions, usually one, an inequality has the potential for an infinite number of solutions. For the above example, there are an infinite number of values that are less than $2$.<br />
	For the most part, inequalities can be solved in the same way you solve equations. For example, take the inequality $3x + 7 < 19$. We can subtract $7$ from both sides, simplifying the inequality to $3x < 12$. Dividing both sides by $3$ gives us $x < 4$. At this point, we can stop; this is the solution.<br />
	One thing to note when solving inequalities is that, when multiplying or dividing with a negative number, you need to reverse the inequality sign. If we were to solve the inequality $-2x > 20$, we would divide both sides by $-2$ to remove the coefficient from $x$. Because we divided by a negative number, we must switch the greater than sign to the less than sign. The solution would then be $x < -10$. Below is a table of each sign and its opposite. </p>

<p>Let�s say we have two numbers a and b such that $a> b$. If we subtract b from both sides, we have $a-b> 0$. This means that $a-b$ must be positive. A positive number multiplied by a negative number must be negative, so we know that $a-b$ multiplied by $-1$ must be negative. We can write this as $-1(a-b)< 0$. Simplifying this gives us $�a-(-b) <0$, or that $�a+b <0$. Subtracting b from both sides gives us $�a <-b$. As you can see, the sign has reversed. </p>
