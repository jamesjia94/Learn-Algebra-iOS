\subsection*{Beautiful math in all browsers}

Math\-Jax is an open-\/source Java\-Script display engine for La\-Te\-X, Math\-M\-L, and Ascii\-Math notation that works in all modern browsers. It was designed with the goal of consolidating the recent advances in web technologies into a single, definitive, math-\/on-\/the-\/web platform supporting the major browsers and operating systems. It requires no setup on the part of the user (no plugins to download or software to install), so the page author can write web documents that include mathematics and be confident that users will be able to view it naturally and easily. Simply include Math\-Jax and some mathematics in a web page, and Math\-Jax does the rest.

Some of the main features of Math\-Jax include\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item High-\/quality display of La\-Te\-X, Math\-M\-L, and Ascii\-Math notation in H\-T\-M\-L pages
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Supported in most browsers with no plug-\/ins, extra fonts, or special setup for the reader
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Easy for authors, flexible for publishers, extensible for developers
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}

\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Powerful A\-P\-I for integration with other web applications
\end{DoxyItemize}
