<p><strong><font size= "4">Rational Numbers</font></strong></p>

A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rational number</span> is a number that can be written as \(\frac{a}{b}\), where b is not 0 ( you can’t divide by zero). This basically means that if you can write a number as a fraction, then it is a rational number. Similar to rational numbers are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rational expressions</span>. These are fractions that either have an algebraic expression in the numerator or denominator, or both. Here is how a rational expression might look like:<br />
\[\frac{x+5}{2-x}\]<br />
Given this rational expression, you will often have to evaluate the expression given certain values of x. To do this, just plug in whatever value of x you’re given and simplify. For example, evaluate the above expression for \(x=1\).<br />
\[\frac{6}{1}=6\]<br />

<p><strong><font size= "4">Domain</font></strong></p>

Now that we can evaluate expressions, we will also need to find the domain of them. Remember that the domain is the set of all the values of x for the expression. At first, it might seem like x could be any number, but it’s not. Try plugging \(x=4\) into the following expression:<br />
\[\frac{3}{4-x}\]<br />
You get the expression \(\frac{3}{0}\), and dividing by zero results in an undefined expression. So, x cannot equal 4. This means that we need to exclude 4 from the domain, which can be done like this:</p>
<p>\[\text{Domain: }(-\infty,4)\cup(4, \infty)\]</p>
<p>Or like this:</p>
<p>\[\text{Domain: }\{ x, x\neq4\}\]</p>
<p>Both of these forms just say that x can be anything except for 4. Here, 4 a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">restriction</span> because x cannot be 4. Take note that when trying to determine restrictions, we only cared about the denominator, because only dividing by zero gives you an undefined expression. For example, if the expression looked like this:<br />
\[\frac{5x-1}{4}\]<br />
Then the domain would be all real numbers, because any value of x would make the expression defined.  An effective way to determine restrictions is to just set the denominator equal to 0, and solve for x. w The answers you get will be the restrictions.</p>

<p><strong><font size= "4">Simplifying Rational Expressions</font></strong></p>

<p>You may remember how to simplify fractions. To do this, you just need to find common factors of the numerator and denominator, and divide the both of them by it. With rational expressions it is just about the same. Look at this expression and try to simplify it:<br />
\[\frac{(4x+2)(x-1)}{(x-1)(5-x)}\]<br />
As you can see, there is \((x-1)\) in both the numerator and denominator, so we can divide both of them by \((x-1)\). It is easiest just to remember that if it appears in both the top and bottom, you can just cross both of them off. So, you end up with this:<br />
\[\frac{(4x+2)}{(5-x)}\]<br />
And you leave the answer like this. You must be careful, however, if the question asks you to find the domain as well, which it often will. If we try to find the domain with our final answer, the only restriction we come up with is x cannot equal 5. But, looking at the original expression, we find that x also cannot equal 1. So, always remember to use the original expression when finding the domain.</p>
<p>Another thing to watch out for when you cross things off is to make sure that you are only crossing things that can be divided away. For example, what can you cross off in this expression:<br />
\[\frac{2x-5}{2x+1}\]<br />
You might think that you can get rid of the 2x on the top and bottom, but you can’t. Try dividing the top and the bottom by 2x and you’ll see that you that nothing is simplified.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can also cross off groupings that do not look exactly like each other. Look at this expression:<br />
\[\frac{(x-1)}{(1-x)}\]<br />
At first they might look different, but really one is just the negative of the other. Try multiplying either the numerator or denominator by -1. You’ll find out that they end up being the same thing if you do. So, the way to deal with this type of situation is to cross these out, then multiply the whole term by -1. Try it on the following expression:<br />
\[\frac{(2x-1)(x+4)}{(1-2x)}\]<br />
We can cancel out \((2x-1)\) and \((1-2x)\) and add a negative sign in front (the same thing as multiplying by -1), leaving us with \(-(x+4)\) as our answer.</p>
