In order to graph a line, you must first learn the basics of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rectangular coordinate system</span>. The most important parts of this coordinate system are the x-axis and y axis. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">x-axis</span> is the horizontal line labeled with an x, and the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">y-axis</span> is the vertical line labeled with a y, and it will be like this for any rectangular coordinate system, which we will call a graph from now on. These two lines create a 2D surface call a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">plane</span>, where we can plot points on. Any point on this plane has 2 numbers associated with it, called an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate. A special point you have to know is the origin, which is where the x and y axis cross. Its x- and y-coordinates are both 0. When plotting points, always start from the origin. The graph below shows an example of a point with its x- and y-coordinate listed and the origin labeled:</p>

<p><b><font size= "4">Plotting Points</font></b></p>


<p>The x- and y-coordinates of a point can be determined by looking at the numbers just next to the x and y axes. As you can see, our point is right above the 1 on the x-axis and to the right of the 2 on the y-axis, so the x- and y-coordinates are 1 and 2. Usually, the coordinates for a point will be written in the \((\text{x-coordinate}, \text{y-coordinate})\), called an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ordered pair</span>. So, our point could be labeled as \((1,2)\). Note that there are also negative numbers on the axes, which means that ordered pairs can also have negative numbers in them. For example, let’s plot the point \((-2,4)\).</p>
<p><img src="2-1-2.png" alt="2-2-1 GOES HERE" align=center></p>
<p>To do this, we first look at the ordered pair. Because the x-coordinate is negative, we go 2 spaces to the left from the origin. Because the y-coordinate is positive, we then go 4 spaces up. The arrows on the graph show how we got to our point.</p>


<p><b><font size= "4">Quadrants</font></b></p>


<p>Every graph also consists of four quadrants, labeled quadrant I, II, III, and IV (they are always labeled using these roman numerals), and are divided by the x and y axes. The quadrants are labeled below:</p>

<p><b><font size= "4">The Distance Formula</font></b></p>



<p>A useful thing to be able to do when given two points is find the distance between them. To do this, we must first remember the Pythagorean formula, \(a^2+b^2=c^2\). The graph below shows the line a, b, and c in relation to the 2 points \((1,5)\) and \((4,1)\).</p>
<p><img src="2-1-4.png" alt="2-1-4 GOES HERE" align=center></p>
<p>Here, line c is the distance between the two points, and we will solve for it by using the lengths a and b, which we can figure out from the graph. To find a and b, we can easily count the number of spaces each line covers. Line a is 4 units in length and line b is 3. Then, by rearranging the Pythagorean theorem, we come up with the equation \(c= \sqrt{a^2+b^2}\), which we can use to solve for c, which happens to be 5. While this is one way of finding the distance, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">distance formula</span>, shown below, is much easier to use:<br />
\[c=\sqrt{(x_1-x_2 )^2+(y_1-y_2 )^2 }\]<br />
To use this formula, label one ordered pair as \((x_1, y_1)\), and the other as \((x_2, y_2)\). It does not matter which one is which. Then just plug the numbers into the formula. Let’s do the problem above again, this time using the distance formula. First we which point is \((x_1, y_1)\) and which point is as \((x_2, y_2)\). We have picked \((1,5)\) to be \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((4,1)\) to be \((x_2, y_2)\). So, the equation would look like:<br />
\[c=\sqrt{(1-4)^2+(5-1)^2 }<br />
\\c= \sqrt{(-3)^2+(4)^2}<br />
\\c=\sqrt{25}<br />
\\c=5\]<br />
As you can see, we get the same answer as before.<br />



<p><b><font size= "4"> The Midpoint Formula</font></b></p>



Something else you will need to do when given two points is to find the midpoint, or the middle of the two points. To do this, you need to find the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates using the following formula:<br />
\[\frac{x_1+x_2}{2},\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\]<br />
Just as with the distance formula, it does not matter which point you choose to be \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\). Let’s try finding the midpoint of these two points below using the formula:</p>
<p><img src="2-1-5.png" alt="2-1-5 GOES HERE" align=center></p>
<p>First, we choose which points will be (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), as shown above. Then we put the numbers into the formula like so:<br />
\[\frac{1+7}{2},\frac{6+2}{2}\]<br />
Simplifying this gives us the midpoint of \((4, 4)\).</p>
