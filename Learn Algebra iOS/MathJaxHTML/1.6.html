<p><b><font size ="4">Negative Exponents</font></b></p>
<p>Earlier, we briefly discussed the concept of negative exponents. Recall that for any negative exponent:<br />
\[x^{-n}=\frac{1}{x^n}\]<br />
	Basically, any base to a negative exponent would equal to the reciprocal of that exponent to a positive exponent. If a negative exponent is in the denominator of a fraction, then switch it with the numerator of the fraction. This is because the reciprocal of the reciprocal cancels it out, resulting in the lone base. For example:<br />
\[<br />
\frac{1}{x^{-5}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{x^5}} = x^5 \]</p>
<p>If we are to combine this idea with our previous formula, we will then be able to simplify fractions with negative exponents on both the numerator and the denominator. We can then create a new formula, which is shown below:</p>
<p>\[<br />
\frac{x^{-a}}{y^{-b}} = \frac{y^b}{x^a}<br />
\]</p>
<p>Essentially, the two terms “switch places” on the fraction. Note that if you have a coefficient or multiply the exponent by anything else, they would NOT switch positions on the fraction. This is because the exponent only affects the base, not the entire term. For example:</p>
<p>\[<br />
2x^{-3} = 2\left(\frac{1}{x^3}\right) = \frac{2}{x^3} \] </p>
<p>The only time the negative exponent would affect the entire term is if it applies to stuff contained within parentheses. The power would then treat the contents of the entire parentheses as a single base. For example:</p>
<p>\[<br />
(5x)^{-2} = \frac{1}{(5x)^2} = \frac{1}{(25x^2 )} \]</p>
<p>Of course, these examples are relatively simple, and you will undoubtedly run into more complicated exponents to simplify. Here’s an example of one such problem, and a demonstration of how to simplify it:</p>
<p>\[<br />
\frac{(3x^{-2} )^{-3}}{x^{-1}}<br />
\]</p>
<p>We begin by using the power rule on the numerator to simplify the parentheses. This will result in the numerator moving to the bottom, as shown below:</p>
<p>\[<br />
\frac {1}{((3x^{-2} )^3 x^{-1} )}<br />
\]</p>
<p>We can then move the negative exponent in the denominator to the numerator’s position:</p>
<p>\[<br />
\frac{x}{(3x^{-2} )^3 }<br />
\]</p>
<p>Now, it’s time to simplify the parentheses. We distribute the power surrounding the parentheses to each component of the bottom term, separating it and applying it separately. </p>
<p>\[<br />
\frac{x}{((3)^3 (x^{-2} )^3 )}<br />
\\ \frac{x}{(27)(x^{-6} ) }<br />
\]</p>
<p>Now it’s time to switch the negative exponent in the denominator to the numerator.</p>
<p>\[<br />
\frac{x(x^6 )}{27}<br />
\\ \frac{x^7}{27}<br />
\]</p>
<p>And that’s our answer.</p>
