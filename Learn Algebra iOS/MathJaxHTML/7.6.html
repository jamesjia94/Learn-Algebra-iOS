<p><strong>Radical Equations</strong><br />
<p>	Thus far, you have already encountered many types of algebraic equations. Now, it’s time to introduce yet another. Any equation that contains a radical in it is called a <u>radical equation</u>. For example, you may encounter an equation that looks like \(\sqrt{x-1}=5\). Before we can solve this, we must discuss an important property: the squaring property of equality. This property essentially states that:<br />
\[\text{If } a=b\text{, then }a^2=b^2\]<br />
	Basically, we can square both sides of an equation and everything will still be equal. To solve the previous example, we would make use of this property to get rid of the radical sign. We begin by squaring both sides, which leaves us with:<br />
\[x-1=25\]<br />
	Which is easily solved to produce:<br />
\[x=26\]<br />
	Not all the solutions you receive through this process will satisfy the original equation, for example. You must be especially careful around quadratics. For example, let’s say we’re told to solve for x in the equation:<br />
\[\sqrt{5-4x}=x\]<br />
	We begin by squaring both sides, giving us:<br />
\[5-4x=x^2<br />
\\0=x^2+4x-5<br />
\\0=(x+5)(x-1)\]<br />
	This gives us -5 and 1 as the roots. When we plug this back into the original equation, only 1 satisfies the equation. Here’s why:<br />
\[\sqrt{5-4(1)} =\sqrt{1}=1<br />
\\\sqrt{5-4(-5)}=\sqrt{5+20}=\sqrt{25}=5\]<br />
	But wait! Our roots were 1 and NEGATIVE 5, not positive 5. Because of this, -5 is not a solution to this equation. In this scenario, -5 is called an extraneous solution because it does not satisfy the original equation. Always be careful whenever you deal with such problems to avoid extraneous solutions. </p>
