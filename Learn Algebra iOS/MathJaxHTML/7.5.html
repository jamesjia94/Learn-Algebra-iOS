<p><strong>Radicals as Exponents</strong><br />
Recall from the first lesson of this chapter that a square root can also be expressed as an exponent. \(\sqrt{5}\), for example, is equal to \(5^\frac{1}{2}\). While it isn’t necessary to place radicals in this format to work with them, it is significantly easier to work with them in this form. For example, if we wanted to multiply \(\sqrt{5}×\sqrt{5}×\sqrt{5}×\sqrt{5}\), we could either multiply it the conventional way to create \(\sqrt{5×5×5×5}=\sqrt{625}=25\). We could also express it in terms of exponents, changing the \(\sqrt{5}\) to \(5^\frac{1}{2}\). Multiplying all four would then get us: \(5^{\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}}\), which is equal to \(5^2\). While this problem was not too difficult to do the traditional way, it becomes significantly more difficult as the base increases.<br />
	You aren’t limited to square roots when changing radicals to exponents; rather, cube roots can also be changed into an exponent form. Because they are base 3, the fractional exponent is \(\frac{1}{3}\) rather than \(\frac{1}{2}\). You may notice that for any radical with index a (\(\sqrt[a]{x}\)), the exponent form is equal to \(x^\frac{1}{a}\). For example, if we wanted to express \(<br />
\sqrt[8]{162}\) in exponent form, we would write it as \(162^\frac{1}{8}\). The opposite also holds true. If we wanted to put \(27^\frac{1}{3}\) in radical form, we would write it as \(\sqrt[3]{27}\).<br />
	Not all radicals will be expressed to the power of \(\frac{1}{a}\), however; some may be \(\frac{2}{a}\) or \(\frac{3}{a}\). Although the index will still be equal to the denominator, or a, the power of the radicand inside the radical will be raised to the numerator. \(x^\frac{2}{7}\), for example, is equal to \(\sqrt[7]{x^2}\). If an exponent can be simplified in exponent form, such as \(\frac{2}{4}\) simplifying to create \(\frac{1}{2}\), then it is safe to do so. Just as \(9^\frac{2}{4}\)  is equal to \(9^\frac{1}{2}\), \(\sqrt[4]{9^2}\) is equal to \(\sqrt[2]{9}\). </p>
