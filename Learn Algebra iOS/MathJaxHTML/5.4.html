<p><strong><font size= "4">Complex Rational Expressions</font></strong></p>

A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">complex fraction</span> is one where either the numerator or denominator is also a fraction. Here’s an example:<br />
\[\frac{\frac{2}{8}}{\frac{3}{10}}\]<br />
Likewise, a stacked or complex rational expression is just a complex fraction with expressions, like this:<br />
\[\frac{x^2+3}{\frac{5-2x}{3}-5}\]<br />
We will learn how to simplify these stacked fractions into normal ones. To do this, we have to remember that in a fraction, we’re dividing the numerator by the denominator. And, dividing by a rational expression is just multiplying by its reciprocal. So, in order to simplify complex fractions, just multiply the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator. Try this example:<br />
\[\frac{\frac{6x+5}{5}}{\frac{2x}{5}-x}\]<br />
If you look at the denominator, you can see there are actually two terms, so we need to combine them. Doing that gives you:<br />
\[\frac{\frac{6x+5}{5}}{\frac{2x-5x}{5}}\]<br />
Then we just multiply the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator:<br />
\[\frac{5(6x+5)}{5(-3x)}\]<br />
And simplify:<br />
\[\frac{6x+5}{-3x}\]<br />
Another way to simplify stacked fractions is to multiply the numerator and denominator by the LCM (lowest common multiple) of the smaller fractions in the larger fraction. Look at this example:<br />
\[\frac{\frac{2x}{3}+1}{\frac{3+x}{5x}}\]<br />
The lowest common multiple is \(15x\) (3 and \(5x\)). So, we multiple everything by \(15x\), giving us this:<br />
\[\frac{10x^2+15x}{3(3+x)}\]</p>
