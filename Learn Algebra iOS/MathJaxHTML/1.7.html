<p><b><font size ="4"> Scientific Notation</font></b></p>

<p>Sometimes, you will encounter very large or very small numbers which are too large or small to work with effectively. An easy way to express these is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">scientific notation</span>, which allows you to express these numbers as multiples of exponents. The general form is below:</p>
<p>\[a × 10^n \]</p>
<p>In the formula above, a is generally a coefficient that is between \(1\) and \(10\) and three digits long, with a single digit in front of a decimal point and two after it. \(n\) is the power of \(10\) that we multiply by. For example, if we wanted to express \(3,920,000\) in scientific notation, we would break it down into two components. The first is the coefficient, or \(a\), which is the nonzero part of the number, or \(392\). We then separate it from the rest of the number by breaking it into two parts: \(392 × 10000\). If we were to multiply these two numbers, we would return to the original number. Now, we convert the \(10000\) into a power of \(10\), or \(10^4\). We are then left with: \(392 × 10^4\).</p>
<p>But wait! We aren’t done yet. We must transform the \(392\) into a number between \(1\) and \(10\), which we do by dividing by \(100\). This results in the following:</p>
<p>\[<br />
392×\frac{10^2}{10^2} ×10^4<br />
\\ \frac{392}{100}×(10^2×10^4 )<br />
\\ 3.92×10^6 \]</p>
<p>By dividing \(392\) by \(100\), we must also multiply by \(100\) to keep it equal, as shown in the first part of the demonstration above. Then, while we divide \(392\) with the denominator of the fraction, we merge the numerator with the already existing power of \(10\). This allows us to fully convert the number into scientific notation. If we wish to check our answer to make sure it’s correct, we simply evaluate the expression by multiplying \(3.92\) and \(10^6\) together.</p>
<p>Merely knowing how to express numbers in scientific notation isn’t enough, however; you will occasionally be asked to multiply and divide numbers in this form. For example, if we wanted to divide \(46200000\) by \(1540000\), it would take a while by hand. We could, however, do this through scientific notation to make it easier on ourselves. The first step would be to convert the two numbers into scientific notation.</p>
\[<br />
46200000 = 4.62 × 10^7<br />
\\ 1540000 = 1.54 × 10^6<br />
\]</p>
<p>Then, dividing time! </p>
<p>\[\frac{4.62×10^7}{1.54×10^6}\]</p>
<p>We can split this monster into two different fractions, one with the coefficients and one with the powers.</p>
<p>\[\frac{4.62}{1.54}×\frac{10^7}{10^6}\]</p>
<p>Then, it’s a simple matter of simplifying the left and right fractions independently, to provide us our answer as \(3 × 10^1 = 30\).  </p>
