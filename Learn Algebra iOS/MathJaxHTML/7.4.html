<p><strong>Multiplying and Dividing Radical Expressions</strong><br />
Recall from the previous section that we cannot simply add the radicands to add radicals (E.g., \(\sqrt{4}+\sqrt{12}\) is not equal to \(\sqrt{4+12}\). When it comes to multiplying and dividing, however, you CAN work directly with the radicands. For example, \(\sqrt{4}×\sqrt{9}\) IS equal to \(\sqrt{36}\) (you can confirm this by simplifying the two roots, 2 and 3, and multiplying them to equal 6, or the root of 36). The same goes for dividing; you divide the interiors first.<br />
To multiply a radical and a whole number, you simply put the two together. For example, \(2×\sqrt{5}=2\sqrt{5}\). Nothing fancy.<br />
In order to divide radicals, you follow the same steps as multiplication. For example, \(\frac{\sqrt{20}}{\sqrt{5}}\) is equal to \(\sqrt{\frac{20}{5}}=\sqrt{4}=2\)<br />
When you must multiply and divide radicals with coefficients, you multiply and divide the coefficients separately from the radicals. For example, if you wanted to multiply \(3\sqrt{5}×5\sqrt{7}\), you would multiply the coefficients (3 and 5) together, while multiplying the radicals \(\sqrt{5}\) and \(\sqrt{7}\) together. You will then have 15 and \(\sqrt{35}\), which gives us a solution of \(15\sqrt{35}\). While \(\sqrt{35}\) cannot be simplified in this scenario, you should always check at this step whether the solution can be further simplified before you finish.</p>
<p><strong>Rationalizing the Denominator</strong><br />
If you ever have a fraction that contains a radical, it is common to undergo a process called <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rationalizing the denominator</span>. Essentially, you modify the fraction to get rid of the radical in the denominator. To do this, you multiply by a new fraction that has the denominator of the old fraction in both the numerator and denominator of the new fraction. Here’s an example to help make sense of that. Let’s say that we wanted to rationalize the fraction \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\). We would multiply by a new fraction that has the old fraction’s denominator (\sqrt{3) in both the numerator and denominator. Thus, we multiply by \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}\), providing us the expression:<br />
\[\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}×\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}\]<br />
From here, we multiply the numerators and denominators as we would any other fraction. This gives us:<br />
\[\frac{1×\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}×\sqrt{3}}<br />
\\\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\]<br />
And that’s our final solution.<br />
Not all fractions will be this easy to rationalize. You may encounter problems that have complex expressions in the denominator. For example, you may be asked to rationalize the denominator of:<br />
\[\frac{3x}{\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y}}\]<br />
If we just multiplied the expression by a fraction that was composed of \(\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y}\), we would end up with a fraction that had \(x^2+2\sqrt{xy}+y^2\) (recall the expanded form of \((a+b)^2\)). In order to get rid of the center radical, we must multiply by the opposite of the denominator. Recall that the expanded form of \((a+b)(a-b)\) is equal to \(a^2-b^2\). Thus, we multiply by a fraction that is equal to the original fraction’s denominator, but with a minus sign instead of a plus sign. This gives us:<br />
\[\frac{3x}{\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y}}*\frac{\sqrt{x}-\sqrt{y}}{\sqrt{x}-\sqrt{y}}\]<br />
Which simplifies to:<br />
\[\frac{3x\sqrt{x}-3x\sqrt{y}}{x-y}\]</p>
