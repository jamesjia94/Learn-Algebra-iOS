<p><strong><font size ="4">Introduction to Exponents</font></strong></p>

<p>In the past, you may have learned about squares such as \(2^2\) and \(3^2\). In algebra, you can write squares as \(x^2\), which means \(x*x\), or \(x\) multiplied by itself twice. Now, we’re going to take this concept one step further. \(x^3\) would be \(x*x*x\), or \(x\) multiplied by itself three times. \(x^4\) would be \(x*x*x*x\). From this pattern, we can see that:<br />
\[x^n=x*x*x…*x \, \text{for n times}\]</p>
<p>\(x^n\), read as “\(x\) to the power of \(n\),” is called the exponent form. \(x\) is the base, the number or variable that is multiplied. The small number on the upper right of the base is called the power, the number of times the base is multiplied by itself. Exponents are useful when you are multiplying a number by itself many times. You may want to memorize that a variable without an exponent is implied to be raised to the power of \(1\), and anything raised to the power of \(0\) equals to \(1\).</p>


<p><strong><font size ="4">Multiplying Exponents</font></strong></p>


<p>The first rule is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">product rule of exponents</span>, which describes what happens when you multiply two exponents together. This rule states that:</p>
<p>\[x^n*x^m=x^{(n+m)}\]</p>
<p>So, if we were to multiply \(2^2\) and \(2^3\) together, we would get \(2^\left(2 + 3\right)\), or \(2^5\). Here’s why: if we expand \(2^2\), we get \(2*2\). If we expand \(2^3\), we get \(2*2*2\). Now, if we multiply everything together, we would get \(2^5\) as seen below:</p>
<p>\[2^2 * 2^3<br />
\\ \left(2*2\right)*\left(2*2*2\right)<br />
\\ \left(2*2*2*2*2\right)<br />
\\ 2^5 \]</p>


<p><b><font size ="4">Dividing Exponents</font></b></p>

<p>The opposite holds true for division. If multiplying \(x^n\) and \(x^m\) results in the addition of the powers, then logically, dividing \(x^n\) by \(x^m\) would result in subtraction. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">quotient rule of exponents</span> states that:</p>
<p>\[<br />
\frac{x^n}{x^m} = x^{\left(n-m\right)}<br />
\]</p>
<p>Another thing to remember is that a number with a negative power can be written as such:</p>
<p>\[<br />
y^\left(-n\right)= \frac{1}{y^n}<br />
\]</p>
<p>Now, let us look at an example. Take the following expression:</p>
<p>\[<br />
2x^2 y^2*\frac{\left(5x^8\right)}{y^3} \] </p>
<p>This expression contains two variable, x and y. To simplify, we perform a process called grouping like terms. We move all like terms next to each other – variables go with variables, coefficients go with coefficients, so on and so forth:</p>
<p>\[<br />
\left(2*5\right)* \left(x^2*x^8\right)*(  \frac{y^2}{y^3} )<br />
\]</p>
<p>	We then simplify the groups one by one, multiplying \(2\) and \(5\), \(x^2\) and \(x^8\), and so on, using the product and quotient rules as necessary. The resulting expression is this: </p>
<p>\[<br />
10*x^{10}*y^\left(-1\right)=\frac{10x^{10}}{y}<br />
\]</p>

<p><strong><font size ="4">Adding and Subtracting Exponents</font></strong></p>


<p>When adding or subtracting variables with the same base and power, you can treat them as you would treat any normal variable. For example, \(2x^2+3x^2=5x^2\).<br />
However, you cannot add or subtract terms with different bases or powers. Although the two terms in the expression \(3x^2+5x\) both contain \(x\), you cannot add them together because they have different exponents. Similarly, you cannot further simplify the expression \(4x^2+7y^2\) because, while the variables are raised to the same power, their bases are not equal.<br />
When you encounter terms with multiple variables, such as one with both \(x\) and \(y\) in it, the exponents of BOTH of the variables must match those of the term you are adding it to. For example, if you’re asked to simplify \(x^2 y+2xy+4xy+xy^2+y\), only the terms \(2xy\) and \(4xy\) can be added to each other. \(x^2 y+6xy+xy^2+y\) is your answer.</p>





<p><strong><font size ="4">Exponent Power!</font></strong></p>


<p>So far, we have discussed exponents with single powers in the form \(x^n\). You will also have to solve problems that raise whole exponents by another power:<br />
\[<br />
\left( 2x^5 \right)^3<br />
\]</p>
<p>Whenever you encounter an expression like this, be careful to notice what is inside the parentheses and what is outside. The power outside the parentheses treats everything inside as a single term, and multiplies it that many times. So we would simplify it as:<br />
\[ (2x^5 )*(2x^5 )*(2x^5 )<br />
\\ (2*2*2)*(x^5*x^5*x^5 )<br />
\\ 8x^{15} \]</p>
<p>Notice that the power of the exponent inside the parentheses was multiplied by the power outside the parentheses. This brings us to the power rule of exponents.<br />
\[<br />
(x^m )^n=x^{\left(m*n\right)} \]</p>
<p>This makes it possible to simplify exponents with multiple powers. Note that this rule applies to every individual term inside the parentheses, shown by the power rule for a product.<br />
\[<br />
(xy)^n=x^n y^n<br />
\]</p>
<p>The same also applies for quotients, and is called the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">power rule for a quotient</span>:<br />
\[<br />
\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^n=\frac{x^n}{y^n} \]</p>
<p>Now let us look at some examples. Take the expression:<br />
\[(5x^2 y^4 )^2 \]</p>
<p>We begin by breaking the expression into multiple terms: \(5\), \(x^2\), and \(y^4\). Then, we apply the power rule to each term individually, and finish by multiplying all the new terms together like so:</p>
<p>\[5^2*(x^2 )^2*(y^4 )^2=25x^4 y^8\]</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the quotient rule in action. Take the expression:<br />
\[\left(\frac{2x^2}{y}\right)^3\]</p>
<p>Applying the rules to each term individually results in the following:<br />
\[<br />
\frac{2^3*x^{(2*3)}}{y^{(1*3)}} = \frac{8x^6}{y^3}<br />
\]</p>
<p>If possible, always simplify everything inside parentheses before you apply the power rules. </p>
