<p><strong><font size= "4">Solving Equations by Factoring</font></strong></p>
Recall that to solve an algebraic equation, we set the variables on one side and the numbers or terms we solve for on the right side. When trying to solve a polynomial, things are no different. The only difference, is that rather than leaving numbers on one side, we try to simplify it so that everything is on one side while the other side is equal to 0. For example, if we wanted to simplify \(x^2 &#8211; 12 = -4 – 4x\), we would move everything on the left side to the right side, or the right side to the left side. For this example, we will move everything to the left side. We add 4 and 4x to both sides, which leaves us with \(x^2 + 4x &#8211; 12 + 4 = 0\), which simplifies to \(x^2 + 4x &#8211; 8 = 0\).<br />
	The difference between a polynomial equation and a linear single-degree single variable equation is that there could be multiple solutions for the polynomial equation. Each solution is called a root. To find the roots of a polynomial, we rely on a property called the zero-product property, which is as follows below:</p>
<p> <center>If \(a * b = 0\), then either \(a = 0\) or \(b = 0\) or both</center><br />
	So, to solve a polynomial, we try to solve for the polynomial equaling zero. To do this, we first factor the polynomial into a factored form. For the previous example, it would factor to \((x + 4)(x &#8211; 2)  = 0\). By the zero product property, either \((x + 4)\) or \((x – 2)\) must equal 0 (or both). To find the roots, we solve both of these individually for 0, solving \(x + 4 = 0\) and \(x – 2 = 0\). For \(x + 4 = 0\), \(x = -4\), and for \(x – 2 = 0\), \(x = 2\). Our roots for this polynomial are then 2 and -4.<br />
	Not all polynomials have multiple solutions, though; some have only one. For example, let’s say we wanted to solve the equation \(x^2 + x + 3 = 2 – x\). To do this, we start by moving everything to the left side, resulting in \(x^2 + x + x + 3 – 2 = 0\), which simplifies to \(x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0\). This then factors to \((x + 1)(x + 1) = 0\). We solve both of the things inside the parentheses for 0. But wait! Both of them are the same, and both yield a root of -1. In this situation, we only have one root, -1, which is called a double root. This is our only solution to the equation.<br />
	Sometimes, you will be provided the solutions to the equation, and told to find the equation that matches the given answers. For example, if you’re given that the roots of the polynomial are 3 and -5, you can create a polynomial by working backwards. Recall that when solving a polynomial, we set (root – number) = 0, and we solve for root by finding the negative of the number. Now that we’re given the root, we can fill in the number with the negative of the root. Since our roots are 3 and -5, we can create the two parentheses as (3 – 3)(-5 + 5) = 0. To finish the parentheses, we replace all the roots with a variable, in this case, \(x\). Our final polynomial would be \((x – 3)(x + 5) = 0\), which we can expand if we so desire, or if we are told to.<br />
	You may sometimes be provided roots that are fractions. For example, let’s say our roots are -1/2 and 1. We COULD do it the same way we did the previous example, giving us \((x + \frac{1}{2})\) but then we would get an ugly fraction as one of our numbers, which we don’t want. Instead, we would multiply the entire fraction parentheses part by the denominator to get rid of the fraction. This leaves us with \((2(x)+ 2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right))\), which simplifies to \((2x + 1)\). Our other root is simply 1, which we can change back into a binomial through the steps outlined above. This will leave us with \((x – 1)\), which when combined with \((2x + 1)\), gives us our final solution of \((2x + 1)(x – 1)\).</p>
